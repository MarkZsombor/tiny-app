## Features and Functionality

After registering an account, users can create short urls that will be associated with their account. These urls can be shared anywhere.

Client-side session management (implemented using cookie-sessions) makes the application stateful without compromising security. Bcrypt is used for password encryption to ensure the protection of user information.
